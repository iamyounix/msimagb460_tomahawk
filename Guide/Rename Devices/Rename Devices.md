# Rename Device

This code demonstrates how to rename any device that macOS does not recognize.Â In this case, PCI devices shown in IORegistryExplorer such as `pci8086,1911@8` or `pci8086,9def@14,2` to something more meaningful such as ACPI Devices like `MCHC`, `TSUB` or `PGMM` etc.

#### MCHC (Memory Controller Hub Configuration)

```asl
/*
* It defines a device object with a single method, _ADR, which stands for "address". The value of the _ADR method is Zero, 
which is a predefined constant in the ACPI language that represents the value zero. The purpose of the _ADR method is to 
return the address of the device. In the context of this code, the device is referred to as MCHC. The _ADR method is used
to specify the address at which the device can be accessed.

DefinitionBlock ("", "SSDT", 2, "CpyPst", "MCHC", 0x4D434843)
{
    External (_SB_.PCI0, DeviceObj)

    Scope (\_SB)
    {
        Scope (PCI0)
        {
            Device (MCHC)
            {
                Name (_ADR, Zero)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### PGMM (Processor Gaussian Mixture Model)

```asl
/*
* It defines a device object with a single method, _ADR, which stands for "address". The value of the _ADR method is Zero, 
which is a predefined constant in the ACPI language that represents the value zero. The purpose of the _ADR method is to 
return the address of the device. In the context of this code, the device is referred to as PGMM. The _ADR method is used
to specify the address at which the device can be accessed.

    Scope (\_SB)
    {
        Scope (PCI0)
        {
            Device (TSUB)
            {
                Name (_ADR, 0x00080000)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### TSUB (Thermal Subsystem)

```asl
/*
* It defines a device object with a single method, _ADR, which stands for "address". The value of the _ADR method is Zero, 
which is a predefined constant in the ACPI language that represents the value zero. The purpose of the _ADR method is to 
return the address of the device. In the context of this code, the device is referred to as TSUB. The _ADR method is used
to specify the address at which the device can be accessed.

{
    External (_SB_.PCI0, DeviceObj)

    Scope (\_SB)
    {
        Scope (PCI0)
        {
            Device (TSUB)
            {
                Name (_ADR, 0x00140002)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### If (_OSI ("Darwin")) implementation:

The `If (_OSI ("Darwin"))` statement tests whether the operating system is Darwin (which is the operating system used by macOS). If the operating system is `Darwin`, the block of code defined within the `If` statement will be executed. This block of code includes a Device statement, which defines a device object. The device object is named `MCHC` and has a single method, `_ADR`, with a value of `Zero`. So if another operating system other than macOS, this device is not rename.

```asl
DefinitionBlock ("", "SSDT", 2, "CpyPst", "MCHC", 0x4D434843)
{
    External (_SB_.PCI0, DeviceObj)

    Scope (\_SB)
    {
        Scope (PCI0)
        {
            If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
            {
                Device (MCHC)
                {
                    Name (_ADR, Zero)  // _ADR: Address
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
