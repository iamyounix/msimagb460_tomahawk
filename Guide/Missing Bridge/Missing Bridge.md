# Missing Bridge

PXSX is a generic device identifier that is used to refer to a PCIe device in the system. It does not identify a specific device, but rather indicates that the device is a PCIe device that is connected to the system. Certain machines recognise PXSX as `pci-bridge`. In other case, PXSX is used as a USB device and most probably connected to the M.2 slot. 

ie: `SB` / `PCI0` / `PEG0` / `PEGP` / `pcibridge`
